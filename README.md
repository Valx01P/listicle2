## Notes

I had a little trouble thinking of a cool idea for the website, the one I originally made for the first project really sucked and was rushed, I made it about stocks because I at least find it cool, but an idea sharing website for porject ideas is a much cooler website which I feel has a lot of room for upgrades and improvements.
